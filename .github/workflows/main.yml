# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    tags:
      - '**'
    

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

 # specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets from the project on GitHub
    env:
      CF_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
      GITHUB_OAUTH: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # "GITHUB_TOKEN" is a secret always provided to the workflow
                                                 # for your own token, the name cannot start with "GITHUB_"

    # "steps" holds a list of all the steps needed to package and release our AddOn
    steps:

      # we first have to clone the AddOn project, this is a required step
      - name: Clone project
        uses: actions/checkout@v1  # note: checkout@v2 breaks git history, so generating a changelog and
                                   # file naming for non-tagged builds will not work properly

      # once cloned, we just run the GitHub Action for the packager project
      - name: Package and release
        uses: BigWigsMods/packager@v1
